## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

  - Being respectful and receptive to your partner's needs, schedule, learning style, and communication style. 
  - Establishing a safe, welcoming, and comfortable space where we feel open to learn and vocalize any concerns and disagreements.
  - Being mindful of keeping our communication channels open.  

## Collaboration vs. individual work expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations- does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

  - Ideally, we aim to collaboratively code together as much as possible throughout the entire project. However, if we reach a point where we can no longer make any efficient progress on problem-solving, we will try to work on it separately, regroup, and share our ideas the following day when we reconvene. From there, we will decide how to best solution together or how to best proceed from there.
  - In terms of tools and technologies that will help our collaboration, we find Slack or Zoom to be useful in keeping the communication channels open remotely outside class hours.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

  - Embracing vulnerability and better understanding areas where we each feel anxiety or pressure in team settings. 
  - Live coding is usually a source of nervousness since we never want to be a burden on each other and value each other. Hence, we've established affirmations that help make the project setting or environment more conducive for supporting one another. This involves never judging one another for taking a certain amount of time to think through a problem, providing supportive encouragement during live codes, and celebrate mistakes as learning opportunities. 

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

-  Delivering feedback in a respectful and considerate manner.
-  Constructive feedback that comes from good intentions.
-  Examples when giving feedback would be helpful.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

  - Developing soft skills.
  - Being able to talk about code that is understandable.
  - Being able to feel safe to share what is needed from your group at the moment.
  - Being able to better communicate alogithmic thought process or logic in a more artculate way.
  - Collaborative problem-solving and active listening.
